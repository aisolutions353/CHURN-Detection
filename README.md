## README for Corn Detection Project

### Description
This project utilizes TensorFlow and other machine learning libraries to perform corn detection. The Jupyter notebook included in this repository details the process from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

### Prerequisites
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
1. **Clone or download this repository** to your local machine.

2. **Set up an Anaconda environment**:
   - Open Anaconda Prompt and create a new environment:
     ```
     conda create --name corn_detection python=3.8
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
     ```
     conda activate corn_detection
     ```

3. **Install required libraries**:
   - Navigate to the repository directory in the Anaconda Prompt and run:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   Note: You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file based on the libraries imported in the notebook, or directly install them using `pip` as shown in the notebook:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow==2.12.0
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imblearn
   ```

### Running the Notebook
1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Navigate to the notebook file** in the Jupyter interface and open it.

3. **Run the cells** sequentially to perform the detection tasks.

### Note
- The notebook originally includes a command to mount Google Drive, which is specific to Google Colab. Please ensure that your data paths are correctly set up for your local environment.
